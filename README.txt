This plugin uses shortcodes so you can get the USGS river flow data for a site location.  It also includes a easy to use Site Code Search.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to use a shortcode to display the USGS River Data for a site location.  The shortcode can be included in Posts, Pages and Text Widgets.

The shortcode allows you to set your own title and whether or not to show a graph with it.

Example Shortcode:
[USGS location='09080400' title='Great Place To Fish' graph='show']

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the short code? =

Enter [USGS location='09080400' graph='show' title='The Title'].  The location is the Site Code for the station, graph is set to 'show' to show the graphs, the title is what you want to display as a title.  If this is blank it will display the location name.

= How do I find the Site Code? =

You can find the Site Code quickly and easily by searching for it based on state in the easy to use Site Code Search tab on the plugin settings page.

= Why is the data not updating? =

There is a built in cache for the data.  The data will update every 15 minutes in order to help with site speed and limit the calls to USGS.
